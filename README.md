Confession
==========

Example of confession page, dev version can be seen here: http://xsx4u.pythonanywhere.com/ 

This is an example of confession app. It is a simple app that allows users to post their confessions and once they approved by admin(s) it is published on the main page. Confessions can be liked via Facebook and comments can be left if the user is logged into Facebook. The app is not usign any authentication. All forms require coplition of capthca. Oh, yeah this is also my first app written in Django. 

Django - 1.6
Python - 2.7.4
